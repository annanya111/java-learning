# Java Learning Journey

This repository contains my daily Java practice.
I am learning Java from basics and gradually moving to OOP and DSA.

## Structure
- day01-basics: variables, data types
- day02-input-output: scanner, printing
- day03-conditions: if-else, switch

## Goal
To build strong Java fundamentals and improve problem-solving skills.
